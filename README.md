# Data-Science
Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured, and unstructured data.

Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine). Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.

Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyse actual phenomena" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.

#Data Science Process:
1. Data collention.
2. Data cleaning and processing.
3. Statistical analysis and modeling.
4. Machine learning and predictive modeling.
5. Data visualization and communication.
6. Developing data-driven solutions to real-world problems. The process is iterative and involves going back and forth between different steps as necessary

#Introduction to Numpy
Numpy is a powerful library in Python used for numerical computations. It stands for "Numerical Python" and provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
Hello! Numpy is a powerful library in Python used for numerical computations. It stands for "Numerical Python" and provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

Here are some of the key features and functionalities provided by Numpy:

1. **Arrays:** Numpy's primary data structure is the `ndarray`, which stands for "n-dimensional array." These arrays can be used to store elements of the same data type in multiple dimensions, making it suitable for tasks involving large datasets and numerical computations.
2. **Array Creation:** Numpy provides several methods to create arrays easily, such as `numpy.array()`, `numpy.zeros()`, `numpy.ones()`, `numpy.arange()`, `numpy.linspace()`, etc.
3. **Array Operations:** You can perform various mathematical and element-wise operations on Numpy arrays. For example, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, etc. These operations are efficiently vectorized, making Numpy code fast and concise.
4. **Indexing and Slicing:** Numpy allows you to access elements of arrays using indexing and slicing operations, similar to Python lists.
5. **Broadcasting:** Broadcasting is a powerful feature of Numpy that allows you to perform operations on arrays with different shapes, automatically handling shape compatibility under certain conditions.
6. **Mathematical Functions:** Numpy provides a wide range of mathematical functions like trigonometric, logarithmic, statistical, linear algebra, and more.
